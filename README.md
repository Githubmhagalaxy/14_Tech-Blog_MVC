# 14_Tech-Blog_MVC

# Purpose:
Build a Tech Blog site as Model-View-Controller (MVC)

# Description:
Our challenge this week is to build a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. We’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Our app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

# Built With:
* Handlebars.js
* Sequelize
* npm package
* MySQL
* Heroku
